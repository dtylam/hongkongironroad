# hongkongironroad

Hong Kong railway stations. But in literal translations.

I hate having to update npm/js libraries, so wrote this with vanilla js 😝

With a bit of help from [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/)!

Run locally to debug (this avoids cors problems with local json files):
```bash
# install on first run
npm install -g http-server

http-server -c-1 
```
