Originally, its place name was Shallow Bay (淺灣) because boats got stuck there at low tide. This was deemed inauspicious, so the name was flipped to Complete Bay (全灣) which sounds similar but has an opposite meaning. The final renaming occurred to further decorate it with association to plants and the historic fishing economy, while keeping the same sound."
